# 01_First Basic Program in JavaScript  
This HTML file demonstrates how to include **JavaScript** in a webpage using both **inline and external scripts**.  
## Key Features:  
- **Inline JavaScript (Commented Out)**  
  - `<script>` inside the HTML file.  
  - Displays an alert box with `"Welcome to JS"`.  

- **External JavaScript File (`script.js`)**  
  - The `<script src="js/script.js">` tag links an external JavaScript file.  
  - The script contains `alert("Welcome to JS from external file")`, which triggers an alert box when the page loads.  

## File Structure:  
- `index.html` â€“ Loads the JavaScript file.  
- `js/script.js` â€“ External JavaScript file that runs the alert.  

This example introduces **JavaScript integration** in HTML, helping you understand inline and external scripting. ðŸš€
